      <description>Iâ€™m currently an operations intern at Berkeley Research Computing, developing tools for and assisting researchers with supercomputing in close affiliation with the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab HPCS team.
Previously, I worked for SGT as a contractor at NASA Ames Research Center, working on the Mission Tools Suite to support the airborne science program.
In 2015, I was part of the educational associates program by USRA, also at NASA Ames, primarily working on user interface design for a winter weather dashboard for airline dispatchers.</description>
